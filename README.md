This repository contains a simulation of a k-tape Turing Machine. Having only 1 tape and head creates a very limited structure and it has to perform all actions on one tape (read, write, etc.). However, with the 2 tape machine, you have 2 tapes and 2 heads allowing you to perform parallel tasks and overall improve the efficiency of the machine as compared to the 1 tape machine.
